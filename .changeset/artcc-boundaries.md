### Added

**@squawk/types**

- New `'ARTCC'` value on the `AirspaceType` union for Air Route Traffic Control Center boundary features.
- New `ArtccStratum` union (`'LOW' | 'HIGH' | 'UTA' | 'CTA' | 'FIR' | 'CTA/FIR'`) describing the boundary stratum carried on each ARTCC feature.
- New required `artccStratum: ArtccStratum | null` field on `AirspaceFeature`. Populated for `type === 'ARTCC'`; `null` for all other airspace types. Consumers constructing `AirspaceFeature` objects by hand must now populate the field.

**@squawk/airspace-data**

- Bundled GeoJSON snapshot now includes ARTCC lateral boundaries for every FAA-controlled center, sourced from NASR `ARB_BASE.csv` and `ARB_SEG.csv`. Covers LOW/HIGH strata for the 20 CONUS centers and Anchorage (ZAN), the UTA stratum for Oakland (ZOA), and oceanic CTA/FIR strata for ZAK, ZAP, ZHN, ZHU, ZMA, ZSU, and ZWY. Polygons are simplified with Douglas-Peucker at 0.001 deg tolerance and the bundled file grows by roughly 10 KB gzipped.
- Antimeridian-crossing oceanic boundaries (ZAK and ZAP Pacific FIRs) are split at lon=±180 during the build, so every emitted feature stays within the standard `[-180, 180]` longitude range. A single source stratum can yield multiple features that share the same `(identifier, artccStratum)` pair - mirroring how multi-shape oceanic strata (e.g. ZOA UTA) already work.

**@squawk/airspace**

- New `byArtcc(identifier, stratum?)` method on `AirspaceResolver` that returns every ARTCC feature for a three-letter center code (`'ZNY'`, `'ZBW'`, etc.), with an optional stratum filter.
- `query()` now returns ARTCC features alongside Class B/C/D/E and SUA hits when the queried position falls within a center's stratum. Floor and ceiling on ARTCC features use operational stratum approximations (LOW: SFC to FL180, HIGH: FL180 to FL600, UTA: FL600+, oceanic strata: SFC to unlimited) so altitude-aware queries pick the right stratum.

**@squawk/mcp**

- New `find_artcc_for_position` tool returning the ARTCC features (and stratum) containing a given position and altitude. Defaults `altitudeFt` to 0, which selects the LOW stratum and any oceanic CTA/FIR overlays.
- New `find_artcc_by_identifier` tool returning every ARTCC feature for a center code, with full polygon boundaries and an optional stratum filter.
- `query_airspace_at_position` now includes ARTCC features in its results, and `'ARTCC'` is a valid value in the `airspaceTypes` filter.

### Changed

**@squawk/airspace**

- `byAirport(identifier, types?)` now excludes ARTCC features by default, even when an ARTCC code happens to collide with an airport identifier. Use `byArtcc` for center lookups.

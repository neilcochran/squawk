**@squawk/airspace**

- `AirspaceResolver` is now an object with `.query()` and `.byAirport()` methods instead of a bare callable. Migrate `resolver(query)` call sites to `resolver.query(query)`.

- `byAirport(identifier, types?)` returns every airspace feature whose `identifier` matches (case-insensitive), with full polygon boundary coordinates preserved. Intended for fetching all sectors of a Class B/C/D/E2 airspace around a given airport.

**@squawk/mcp**

- `get_airspace_for_airport` tool: given an FAA or ICAO airport identifier, returns every associated airspace feature (Class B/C/D/E2 surface-area classes by default) with full polygon boundary coordinates, suitable for drawing the full wedding-cake of shells on a terminal diagram.
